            <p>The man behind the famous horror game franchise <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/319510/Five_Nights_at_Freddys/">"Five Nights at Freddy's"</a>. Before he made the first FNaF game, he worked on other games that didn't get that much recognition (Desolate Hope and Chipper and Son's Lumber Co.) The only reason FNaF got to here today was through Chipper and Son's failure. The people wasn't interested when FNaF was annonced and Scott lost all hope for that game. But when the reviews for Chipper and Son's came in, saying the characters in the game looked horrifiying, that gave Scott the chance to bring FNaF into the spotlight. Now there's like 11 games of the series: 10 of them part of the timeline and 1 a spinoff.</p>
